# Unity-Create-with-Code

This is the respository that holds all the code I've written while taking Unity's Create with Code courses as a part of the [Junior Programmer pathway!](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer)

The 5 Prototypes are based off the tutorials that the course provides, as well as the Mod the Cube, Counting Prototype, and Debug Project.

Star Baker, however, is a game I created myself as I took the course. You can play it on itch.io here: https://grachay.itch.io/star-baker

Here's a screenshot of gameplay:

This game is an action side-scroller where the player controls the astronaut with the arrow keys and has to avoid randomly generated asteroids that spawn from off-screen. I faced a lot of challenges while coding this project

All of the assets from the game were downloaded for free from the Unity Asset Store.

Thanks for reading!
